This project is a simple calculator for basic mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulus.
For this project I used JS, HTML and CSS.
The buttons on calculator change color when hovered. 
Calcultor can be used by clicking on the buttons or using keyboard.
The calculator displays and error message when user tried to divide by 0.

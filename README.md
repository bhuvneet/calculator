**calculator**
- This project is a simple calculator for basic mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulus.
- I created this project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- The interactive browser application changes color when the mouse hovers over the buttons. 
- Calculator can be used by clicking on the buttons or using the keyboard.
- Keeping mathematics in mind, it ensures to display an error message when the user tries to divide by 0!
